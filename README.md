# CSELink

A command line tool for UNSW CSE Students. This enables local development with ease of access to cse programs like 'autotest' and 'give'.
Providing users with access to the comfort of their own programming environment and the ability to work offline and sync later.

## Setup

1. Setup ssh on your computer to work with an ssh key (see part 6 of Abiram's guide [here](https://abiram.me/cse-setup))
2. Clone this repo.
3. (Optional but recommend) Either add the cloned repo to your path or move "cselink" to a directory where it will be on the path"
4. Run ```cselink help``` or ```sh <path to cselink> help``` if you skipped step 3

## Disclaimer

Some code may run different on your machine to how it runs on cse machine meaning it may appear correct on your machine but not compile or give incorrect output when run on the cse machine. Make sure to incrementally test what you are writing works on cse servers.
